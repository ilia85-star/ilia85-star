### Hi there 👋
I'm ilia. I'm a highschooler 🏫 with some programming 👨‍💻 skills. I use Arch Linux as my main OS and I'm good at python 🐍. (I know and code with c++ and flutter too)

I'm currently busy with my school 🏫, but I still code a bit.

I'm always ready to learn something new, so feel free to teach me anything!✨
